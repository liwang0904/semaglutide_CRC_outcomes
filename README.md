**Figure 3.**
Figure 3. Comparison of one-year all-cause mortality in patients with CRC and T2D between propensity-score matched semaglutide and other anti-diabetic medication groups. DPP-4i indicates dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors; SGLT2i, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors; SU, sulfonylureas; TZD, thiazolidinediones. Other GLP-1RAs included albiglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, and lixisenatide.
